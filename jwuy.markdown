# Congratulations! You solved the clue and made it!

The shape of the spar and its cables is said to evoke an image of a harp lying on its edge. Another bridge on the Liffey is the James Joyce Bridge which is meant to represent an open book. Samuel Beckett Bridge was built in 2009 and rotates horizontally 90 degrees to allow ships to pass by.

Beckett won the nobel prize for literature in 1969 for his writing. Since Beckett's death, all rights for performance of his plays are handled by the Beckett estate, currently managed by Edward Beckett (the author's nephew). The estate has a controversial reputation for maintaining firm control over how Beckett's plays are performed and does not grant licences to productions that do not adhere to the writer's stage directions.
